📊 LeetCode User Stats

A sleek and interactive web application that fetches real-time LeetCode user statistics and beautifully visualizes coding progress.

🚀 Overview
Demo:  https://lalbabukumar12.github.io/-LeetCode-User-Stats-Interactive-Profile-Analyzer/
LeetCode User Stats allows users to instantly retrieve their coding performance data by simply entering a valid LeetCode username. The app displays important insights including:

✔️ Total Problems Solved

✔️ Difficulty Breakdown — Easy, Medium, Hard

✔️ Global Ranking

✔️ Contribution Points & Reputation

✔️ Progress Circles for Visual Analysis

If the entered username is invalid or does not exist, the app smartly shows a clear “No user found” message.
